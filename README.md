COVID-19 Data Visualization

This repository contains a simple Jupyter Notebook for exploring and visualizing COVID-19 data. The notebook demonstrates how to:

Load COVID-19 datasets using pandas
Explore raw data in tabular form
Visualize daily reported deaths using matplotlib with customized styling
Features
Reads data from covid_data.csv
Displays the dataset directly in the notebook
Generates a large-format plot with:
Black background
Grid lines for readability
Date labels on the x-axis
Daily deceased counts on the y-axis
Requirements
Python 3.x
pandas
matplotlib
Jupyter Notebook
Usage
Place your COVID-19 dataset as covid_data.csv in the repository root.
Open the notebook Covid19.ipynb in Jupyter.
Run all cells to load the data and generate the visualization.

This project is intended as a starting point for simple data visualization with Python and Jupyter. You can expand it by adding more plots, cleaning the dataset, or performing further analysis.
